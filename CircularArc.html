    <h1>Circular Arc</h1>
    <p> Let's consider an open curve joining two endpoints of a segment to form a closed curve of maximum area
        for a fixed perimeter. Then this open curve is a circular arc. We can intiutively see it if we extend
        this open curve to a full circle. We would obtain a circle and the two endpoints of the segment would be
        points of the circle. If we change the shape of the open curve while maintaining the same perimeter,
        we would no more have a circle. This go against <a href="isoperimetric.html"> the isoperimetric theorem</a>,
        and thus, this new curve is not of maximum area.
    </p>
    <p> Now considering our original problem : If we want to enclose a convex polygon inside a closed curve of
        maximum area with a fixed perimeter, we would intuitively obtain a sequence of one or more curves, 
        each one being either a circular arc of similar radius or a segment flush of the polygon.
    </p>
    <p> The reason why the circular arcs should be of similar radius is because a closed curve of maximum area
      has to be convex (see <a href="convex.html">Convexity</a>). For the same reason, the endpoints of these
      circular arcs have to be vertices of the polygon.
    </p>
    <p>To show that they must be of similar radius, we will consider a simple polygon (equilateral triangle) that's
      enclosed by a sequence of circular arcs of different radii and we will then swap a part of each circular arc
      (the segments connecting the two endpoints of each part of circular arc are of same length) 
      with the part of one of the other two circular arc. We will see that we will obtain a non-convex curve of same
      perimeter than the one before the swapping. And as we have seen, a closed curve of maximum area must be convex
      and thus the circular arcs must be of same radius.
    </p>
    <p>To see this, try on the canva below to put 85 for radius 1, 180 for radius 2, and 130 for radius 3. Then click
      on the swap button.
