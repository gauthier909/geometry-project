    <h1>Convexity of a fixed perimeter curve of maximum area</h1>
    <p> Considering a closed curve with a fixed perimeter that maximize the area inside the curve.
        This curve must be convex or else, it is not the curve that maximize the area for the given
        perimeter.
    </p>
    <p>We will intiutively show this by the fact that, if we take two points of the curve for which the segment
        joining these two points is outside the curve (which can be the case with a non-convex curve), we can 
        do a reflection of the part of the curve between our two points with the segment joining these two points.
        With this reflection we obtain a new curve with same perimeter but  the area that the curve covers is bigger.
    </p>
    <p>Here below we show an example to this with a non-convex polygon that we transform following the method described
        above to obtain a same perimeter convex polygon but that covers a bigger area.
