    <h1>Voronoi Diagram</h1>
    <img src="voronoi.png">
    <p>The basic voronoi diagram consist in finitely many points (seeds) in a plane. 
      For each points there is a corresponding region, called a Voronoi cell, 
      consisting of all points of the plane closer to that seed than to any other:</p>
    <p>But in order to compute the enclosed curve of maximum area with a predetermined perimeter, we will
      need the farthest-point Voronoi diagram. It is a variant of the Voronoi diagram, in which each cell of 
      the FPVD (farthest-point Voronoi diagram) contains all the points of the plane that has for farthest seed,
      the same one. So for each cell, instead of containing all the points that share the same closest seed 
      , they share the same farthest seed.
      </p>
    <p>The FPVD can be seen as a tree with n unbounded edges and we can think of the leaves
      of this tree as points at infinity in the direction of these unbounded edges 
      (<cite>Isoperimetric Enclosures</cite> by Greg Aloupis et al.
      and <cite>Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications</cite> by M. de Berg et al.)</p>
    <p>In order to construct the farthest point voronoi diagram we first need to construct the convex hull 
      (using Graham scan) of the points (seeds) to 
      determine the farthest points because a point that is not part of the convex hull cannot be a farthest point
      of a region because there will always be another one that is farther and that is part of the convex hull.
      And then  we will construct the smallest enclosing circle (using Welzl's algorithm) because of some properties.
      Notably the fact that the center of the smallest enclosing circle lies either on a vertex or an edge of the FPVD.</p>
    <p>Below a canva to compute the farthest point voronoi diagram from a set of point. Create this set of points by
      clicking on "Add random point" button (create a point at random coordinates). Then compute the convex hull by 
      clicking on "Draw CH" button. Then compute the smallest enclosing circle by clicking on "Smallest circle" button.
      And finally compute the FPVD by clicking on "FPVD" button. Use the "Clear" button to clear everything.
