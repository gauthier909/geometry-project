    <h1>Isoperimetric Enclosures</h1>
    <p> Let S be a set of n > 2 points in the plane whose convex hull has perimeter t. Given a number
        P ≥ t, we have the following problem: Of all curves of perimeter P that enclose S, which is the
        curve that encloses the maximum area ?
    </p>
    <p> To answer this question, we will use the following algorithm 
      (<cite>Isoperimetric Enclosures</cite> by Greg Aloupis et al.) :
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Compute the smallest enclosing circle that contains S (and thus it's convex hull) and compare
        the perimeter of this circle with P.
      </li>
      <li>If P ≥ perimeter of the smallest enclosing circle : construct the circle that has the same center
        than the smallest enclosing circle with perimeter P.
      </li>
      <li>If P < perimeter of the smallest enclosing circle : As we have seen, the solution will look like
      a sequence of circular arcs with the same radius. First compute the FPVD of S and register all the
      vertices v of the FPVD with their p(v). With p(v) being the radius of the smallest enclosing circle with
      center v. Then sort the vertices by their value under p. We can then approximate the radius of the arcs 
      by doing a binary search in the set {p(v), v is a vertex of the FPVD of S}. We will find  vertices v and u,
      such that for the correct radius r, we have p(v) < r < p(u). At this point, the curve we are looking for has the same
      combinatorial structure for any radius p(v) < r' < p(u). We have thus a combinatorial description 
      of the curve where only the radius p(v) < r < p(u) has yet to be determined.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>(Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to finish the algorithm, so there is no canva)</p>
